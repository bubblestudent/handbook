# Bubble Handbook

---------

Bubble is you

---------

Everyone that is part of the Bubble team represents the Bubble brand. From board member to new team member everyone is the face of Bubble.

Marketing is everyone’s responsibility. Whilst our marketing geniuses will be working tirelessly on their ingenious campaigns, every time anyone is out and about they are representing the brand. Be it talking at an industry event, a meeting, or 6 sherbets down on a Friday night at the Jack Horner, we still all project the image of Bubble onto those around us.

# What we stand for

## Values

### Collaborate
Collaboration plays a huge part in the development of the business. We want to create an atmosphere where people want to bounce ideas off each other instead of worrying about what people will think. If you aren’t able to do something, work with someone that can.
### Automate
Automation allows us to get rid of any unnecessary roadblocks that may slow down a process. Why do something when someone has created something to do it for you? We are always looking for new ways to automate, so members of the team are encouraged to always be on the lookout for new products/services.
### Innovate
We are a young business in a prehistoric market, so keep up to date with industry trends, new technologies and apply them. Find new ways of doing things and think outside of the “bubble” (had to get that in there somehow haha).

## What we do
To our customers/users we are a real-time behavioural analytics and listing platform. We are the only mobile-first student accommodation app, built on an innovative listing platform allowing students to check out tens of thousands of housing options, sharing them instantly with their friend groups and future housemates and booking viewings at the tap of a button.
 
But the real innovation is in how we serves letting agencies. Powered by Zoopla and using emerging technologies such as machine learning and cloud computing, we aggregate accommodation from agencies, landlords of Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs), Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) and private properties on an easy-to-use and free-to-list platform. Not only that, we helps agencies and landlords cut their cost of sale and the time it takes to let a property by offering in-depth behavioural analytics on how and why the property is performing as it does; benchmarking the price relative to other properties; analysing key words in the description; assessing photo quality and content, and evaluating at what point a lead converts or is abandoned.

This is all well and good, but what we really pride ourselves on is bringing together young talent and providing them with the environment to explore new ideas and challenge themselves. Unlike bigger corporate companies we really believe this is the only way to innovate, grow and stay ahead of the curve.

# The journey

At the very start of the Bubble journey Felix and Sol sat down at a pub and came up with an idea, albeit a shit one. After many iterations and countless brainstorming sessions (pints) they eventually settled on the foundations of what was to become the Bubble we see today. From there they kept themselves busy for a few months trying to figure out how  “to business” (for the record they still haven’t figured this out). From expecting a VC to part with £300k at idea stage, to telling industry experts that they were “wrong”, they truly were “shit entrepreneurs”. However, they then surrounded themselves with a team of young, passionate talent and then everything started to tick. After a summer of hard work from everyone involved, Bubble then embarked on its proof of concept year up in Newcastle proving that there was indeed an appetite for the product. Although the app was by no means perfect, it did the job, gained traction and they managed to raise their seed round of investment off the back of it.

Following the proof of concept and injection of capital everything really started to become exciting. The money allowed Bubble to develop a new app and redo both websites, including the money maker - the data analytics platform. 
 



# Who does What?
## The founders

Felix (CEO) - He’s the lawyer, the accountant, the marketing genius, the fundraiser and the voice of reason (mainly directed at Sol). 

Sol (CTO) - He’s responsible for the direction of the product, the man with strong opinions and too many ideas, and one of the only CTOs you’ll meet that can’t actually code.

## Management

Adam (Head of Engineering) - He’s the man that makes all the tech work, the man that always has a solution, the guru of new technologies, and the unfortunate guy that has to digest all of Sol’s new ideas before the last one has even been started.

Finn (Head of Sales) - He’s the man all letting agencies can’t help but love, the one responsible for making agencies part with their cash and the man that sells the dream.




# Where we work 

## Bubble HQ
We work in a great co-working space in the heart of london at 14 Bedford Square, or more specifically “The Den”. The Den is a relaxed and interesting place to work filled with various different startups and like minded individuals. It is also where you’ll find Sol on the “innocent chair” and Felix on the “filing cabinet”.

# Benefits & Perks

## Employee Liquidity pool:
If Bubble is ever sold or part of an IPO, tenured employees will be eligible to receive a portion of 5% of the value of the company. That 5% would be divided into units, based on the number of employees we have at the time. People who were at Bubble for less than 1 year would receive 0 units, someone employed 1 year would receive 1 unit, and so on, until you're fully vested at 5 years for 5 units. This pool is for employees that do not already hold equity in the company.

## Profit Sharing
After our second year of profit, Bubble will begin offering profit sharing to employees. The system is based on two questions at the end of every year...
Was this year our most profitable year ever?
If yes, then how much better did we do than the previous best year? 25% of that profit will be split amongst employees.
If you've been working here for 2-5 years, you get 1 cut of the profit share, and if you've been working here for 5+ years, you get 2 cuts of the share. So, the more people who work at Bubble for 2+ years, the more pieces of pie there are to distribute.



# Getting Started

## Expectations
Getting started at Bubble is exciting yet can be overwhelming. You’ll be entering a fast paced environment with people working on a range of different, interesting projects. To ensure the transition is as seamless as possible each new member of the team will be “paired” with an existing team member that operates in a different area of the business. This will enable you to ask questions, get set up on all of the tools/software we use and to get more of a feel for the business. 

The prospect of meeting and building relationships with your co-workers may also be daunting to some. To make sure that everyone gets to know one another we host “team building” days every three months. These aim to help members of the Bubble team develop friendships outside of the office.

## Setting up
Previous to your start date you will have been set up with a Bubble email account and accounts on all the business tools we use. This means that on your first day you can focus on getting to know how everything works instead of faffing around setting up accounts.


## How we work

### Cycles 
At Bubble we work in 6 week cycles made up of three sprints. This allows us to focus on projects and gives us a target to hit. At the end of a cycle, any projects that were put forward must be “done”, meaning they are ready for market.


### Sprints
Sprints are made up of two weeks. At the beginning of each week, each person sets how many and which tasks will be completed. As with a cycle, everything must be done by the end of the sprint. As the team becomes more productive there should be an increase in “velocity”.


### Heartbeats
- “What have I worked on today” 
At the end of each day every member of the team will post their answer to “what have I worked on today” in the designated slack channel. This is used as a tool to allow everyone in the business to understand exactly what is going on and who is doing what, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

- “What am I going to do this week” 
At the beginning of each week the answer to “what am I going to do this week” will be posted by every member of the team in the designated slack channel. This should be used to outline in relative detail what you will be attempting to do, allowing other team members to learn more about exactly what it is that everyone does. This will hopefully mean that, if used properly, everyone will know roughly how every aspect of the business works, and in turn boost confidence when talking about the business.

- Cycle planning
It is in this session where the projects for the cycle are selected from the backlog. This is to be carried out by the company as a whole.

- Sprint planning
Sprint planning happens first thing in the morning at the start of each sprint. This will be where tasks are selected from the backlog and put into the current sprint. It is during sprint planning that tasks are weighted, enabling the team to figure out how many tasks they can complete in the new sprint. Each individual team has their own sprint planning but others can listen in if they wish.

- Daily standup 
Daily standups happen every morning and last no more than 15 minutes. This should be used by teams to review what was done the previous day, plan what is to be done on the day and to ask any questions. Each individual team has their own daily standups but others can listen in if they wish.

- Sprint review
A sprint review takes place at the end of each sprint. The review should be used to present to the rest of your team what you have done that week.

- Cycle Demo Day
This happens at the end of each cycle. It is on this day that each team presents what they have been working on for the previous 6 weeks to everyone else in the company. 


### Pitches 
Pitches take place on cycle demo day. It is here that anyone in the company can pitch an idea to the rest of the team. The whole company will then decide which ideas are worth pursuing and which aren’t.


# Our rituals

## Recognition
Each quarter everyone will nominate a person in the business for the “recognition prize”. You should nominate the person that you think has made the biggest breakthrough that quarter. Whether that be someone that has created a great new feature, someone that has smashed a sales target, or someone that has put a killer marketing idea into practice. The winner each quarter will receive a small prize.

## Everyone on support
Everyone on support will be used as a tool so that everyone can experience talking directly to our customers and in turn gain a better understanding on what exactly it is that they are looking for. Once a month, each member of the business will spend a day on customer support.

## 1x12s
Every month a different member of the team will grab a drink with Sol and Felix to discuss a topic of their choice. There is nothing you can or can’t talk about as long as it’s anything outside of work. 

## Team building days
Team building days are for unwinding as a team and having a laugh. They will take place every three months and will be a different activity each time.

The head of your team reviews your summary and prepares their own thoughts.
The head of your team will schedule a one-hour meeting to discuss.
The head of your team will reach out to you when it's time for you to write up your review. Of course you can (and should) ask for feedback as often as you'd like it.

# Security

Here at Bubble, we consider security a top priority. Since we have private data on thousands of students and state of the art machine learning software, we want to keep all of that as far away from prying eyes as possible. Our Tech team does its best to ensure that our applications are protected from every threat that we are aware of, but what makes the largest difference to our data's security is what you can do as a Bubble employee.  

# Passwords

We use 1Password at Bubble to manage all of the shared passwords that you might need access to, and you should also use its personal vault to create and store passwords to your personal Bubble related accounts. By using a password manager to generate and store unique, long, and complex passwords, you significantly reduce the risk of a malicious user gaining access to your Bubble accounts and completely eliminate the risk of a password breach that would allow access to your other accounts.

# Two-factor Authentication

The single greatest improvement to the security of your account is to use two-factor authentication (2FA.) 2FA requires a second form of authentication when signing in to your account, the main form that we use at Bubble being a code that is accessed on either a mobile app or through 1Password. This stops a malicious user accessing your account even if they have your password, as they require your physical device also to be able to sign in. Where possible, we set mandatory 2FA for all users, such as on Github and Slack, but some products do not have this feature so you are asked to set up your own wherever you can. 



# Moonlighting

## OK
An occasional side gig, free or paid, for someone you know. For example, if you want to work on a friend’s website, or a design or writing project for something you’ve involved with, that’s fine.
An occasional speaking gig, free or paid. Someone’s going to pay you to give a talk somewhere? That’s fine as long as it doesn’t involve multiple days off for travel (unless you use your own personal vacation time against this travel time).
A side business that’s different from your day job, as long as the commitment is only a few hours a week. If you come to work exhausted because you’re trying to start a full-time business on the side, it’s going to impact your performance here.
Serve as an advisor for another company, or be on a board, as long as there’s no conflict of interest. The time commitment must be under a few hours a month. And if there’s a scheduling conflict, Bubble gets priority.
Do volunteer or occasional pro-bono work for a cause you’re actively involved with. A little work here and there is fine, but, for example, becoming an organisation’s full-time web designer and being on the hook to work during your standard work day, etc, would not be OK.

## Not OK
You can’t work full time or part time for another company in our industry. If you’re unclear about what our industry is, and you have a specific situation you’d like to talk about, ping Felix or Sol.
Go out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. That’s too disruptive to our own work schedule and to your fellow teammates.
Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to Bubble, etc).
Be aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest here at work.
Take on anything outside of work that’ll pull attention from work. For example, if you wanted to launch an app, but the app requires providing timely customer support to people who use the app, that’s going to eat into your day here at work. That would ultimately be a problem.

## In general
Here’s a few guiding principles about whether something could be a problem:
Is it competitive?
Does it occupy a disproportionate amount of your time?
Does it require you to be away during times when you’re needed at work?
Is it another paid gig that employs the same skills Bubble is paying you for?
In general we’d like to be lenient within reason, but we’re going to be strict if we see it impact your time, attention, or performance here at work.
It’s hard to come up with one-size fits all rules. If you’re in doubt, please reach out to Felix or Sol. We’re always happy to spare a moment to give our thoughts on it before you make a commitment.
